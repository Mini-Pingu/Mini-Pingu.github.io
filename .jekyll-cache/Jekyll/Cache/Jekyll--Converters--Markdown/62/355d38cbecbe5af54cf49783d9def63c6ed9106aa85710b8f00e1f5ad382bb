<p>This is my simple log site, which is divided into five sections: index, posts, todo, log, and about.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The purpose of this site is for recording what I learn everyday at a start-up company. All the production, servering, and maintenance are developed by Javascript technology stack, such as node.js, react, react native, strapiâ€¦ Which means those technology are included in my studying plan in the next half year at least, I guess. <br /><br /></p>

<p>I will occasionally update post when something big occurs, but must keep logging daily snippet at todo and log page before sleep. <br /><br /></p>
