# <center>Mini-Pingu's Log</center>
This is my simple log site, which is divided into five sections: index, posts, todo, log, and about.<br/><br/>


The purpose of this site is for recording what I learn everyday at a start-up company. All the production, servering, and maintenance are developed by Javascript technology stack, such as node.js, react, react native, strapi... Which means those technology are included in my studying plan in the next half year at least, I guess. <br/><br/>

I will occasionally update post when something big occurs, but must keep logging daily snippet at todo and log page before sleep. <br/><br/>
