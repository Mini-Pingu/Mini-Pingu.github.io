# <center>Mini-Pingu's Log</center>
This is my simple log site, which is divided into five sections: index, posts, todo, log, and about.<br/><br/>


This site is for recording what I learn & work everyday at a start-up company. All the production, servering, and maintenance are rely on Javascript technology stack, such as node.js, jQuery, react, react native, strapi... Which means those technology are included in my studying plan in the coming days, I guess. <br/><br/>

I will occasionally update post when something big occurs, but must keep logging daily at tasks page before sleep. <br/><br/>
